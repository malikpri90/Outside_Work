# Outside_Work

How to get set up: 
1) Activate VSCode with Conda Environment (https://python.plainenglish.io/installing-vs-code-with-conda-environment-a-step-by-step-guide-with-code-example-7eb00ab89e17)

2) Install required packages
numpy==1.21.2
pandas==1.3.3

3) Install Jupyter Lab extension (optional). I find this an easy way to test code in blocks for data discovery and initial build. It can then be converted to a .py script at the end of the process for automation

4) Test Fitzroy_discovery.ipynb script to make sure access works
